# TSID Framework

The **TSID Framework** is a robotics software package built on top of the [Task-Space Inverse Dynamics (TSID)](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/tsid) library. This framework leverages the TSID library to implement controllers for robot manipulation and motion planning. 

In this package, we provide a set of ROS2 controllers, including the **Cartesian Space Controller**, which allows precise control of the robot's end-effector frame in Cartesian space.

## Features

- **Integration with the TSID Library**: Leverages advanced inverse dynamics techniques for task-space control.
- **ROS2 Controllers**: Implements controllers compatible with the ROS2 control stack.
- **Interactive Control**: Supports `rviz2` for intuitive interaction using an interactive marker.

## Cartesian Space Controller

The **Cartesian Space Controller** controls the robot's end-effector by directly specifying Cartesian positions, velocities, and orientations, enabling precise and intuitive manipulation.

## Joint Space Controller

The **Cartesian Space Controller** controls the robot's joints by directly specifying the joint configuration though topic.

### How to Launch the Controllers

**Launch the Cartesian Space Controller**:

Run the following command to start the controller:
```bash
ros2 launch tsid_controllers cartesian_space_controller.launch.py
```
Open Rviz2 and spawn the interactive marker:
```bash
ros2 run rviz2 rviz2
```

Switch controllers (for example run the controller on right side): 
```bash
ros2 control switch_controllers --activate cartesian_space_controller --deactivate arm_right_controller
```
âš  **Warning**: This controller is specifically customized for the **INRIA robot** and its simulation environment. If you wish to use it, ensure you are using the INRIA robot simulation setup. 


**Launch the Joint Space Controller**:
Run the following command to start the controller:
```bash
ros2 launch tsid_controllers joint_space_controller.launch.py 
```

Switch controllers (for example right arm side):
```bash
ros2 control switch_controllers --activate joint_space_controller --deactivate arm_right_controller
```

Publish on the topic the desired joint configurations (for example 0 for all the joints of the right arm):
```bash
ros2 topic pub --once /tsid_controllers/joint_position_cmd std_msgs/msg/Float64MultiArray "data: [0.0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ,0]"
```

It is possible to modify dynamically some parameters like velocity_scaling factor, posture gain etc.
